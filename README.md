 the Real Life Corruption Scenarios is a project intended to capture reports of case of corruption where a company is being bribed, blackmailed, or otherwise influenced to act against moral ethics, and how they either over came the situation, or if they require help finding solutions to their own situation.  This application is intended to capture these events, have a team to validate their authentisity, and then publish the scenario for the world to learn and get through their own cases of the same situation.
 
Search can also be done on the scenarios by location, industry type, or just by general queries of the text, and will hopefully help to expose sources of corruption.
